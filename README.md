# SPECIAL OFFER INC TECH ASSESMENT

## GOALS
For this technical assessment, execute a Figma design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Please do not use any CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. 
The design includes copy text and a form overlaid on top of a background image. 

## FUNCTIONALITY

- When the form submits, remove the background image and change the background color to one of your choosing. 
- Hover states on buttons and form fields is a plus.

## RESULTS
I believe I was able to successfully meet all the requirements for the assesment, recreating/interperting the Figma to code as best as I saw
- Some adjustments were made based on my own interpertation of the file (i.e some items centered more, and some margins adjusted)
- When a user hits the submit button, the background will update to a solid color
- some html included error handling added for the form inputs
- hover and active states added for submission button
- mobile view edited for responsive design
